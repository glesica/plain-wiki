## About

This template is designed to produce a simple-looking, mobile-friendsly wiki with minimal visual clutter and reasonable aesthetics. It is meant to look more like a blog or CMS than a wiki. It has the following features:

* Main menu
* Content boxes
* Page footer

It uses the Less framework (http://lessframework.com/) to support mobile browsers. The page is automatically reformatted based on the size of the viewing window.

## Future

This is still a work-in-progress and there are quite a few things left to do. I will maintain a to-do list on the Github wiki (weird).
